         Could throwing a tomato at a task actually help you be more productive?

---
I have a mountain of tasks on my to-do list. Some of them are so exciting and I can’t wait to get to them while others are, well, **BORING** and I try to find every excuse **NOT** to do them. You’re probably nodding your head in agreement and want a magic pill solution to get over procrastination for good.

Yeah, that’s not going to happen.

As humans procrastinate for a variety of reasons: decision fatigue, trouble planning, the project seems too big and more. There are even blockers from a neuro-cognitive level that could be holding you back. Before you try what I’m going to suggest I encourage you to try to get to the root cause of what’s blocking you. *All procrastination isn’t created equal and shouldn’t be attributed to laziness on your part*.

For me, the number one source is the scope of a problem - just how big the effort is. I’ll look at some work and get blocked on starting because I’ll be intimidated. Recently, I was on Twitter talking about a task and [Bria Sullivan](https://twitter.com/bria_sullivan) chimed in with a perfectly reasonable solution: use your tomato timer and start.

It worked like a charm.

Since that conversation I’ve been looking at big tasks and saying to myself throw a tomato at it. I’ve been consistently enjoying the freedom from the guilt of not starting things.

But wait, what’s a tomato timer?

This working style is called the **Pomodoro Technique**. Here’s what it looks like:

25 minutes: uninterrupted, distraction-free focused work

5 minutes: take a break and do whatever GUILT FREE

Repeat

(after a few rounds, you can extend your break to 10 minutes, then back to 5 minute breaks)

You can use this technique to boost your productivity throughout the day but I’ve found it especially helpful to do this when I’m blocked. I’ll throw a tomato at a problem and honestly, I’ve found that I make more progress than I expected. What’s better is that the problem is no longer as intimidating. Sometimes I’ll even do multiple rounds on the problem and just knock it out. Either way, I’m ALWAYS glad that I started.
​
Here’s what I want you to do now - look at your to-do list, find an item you’ve been putting off and throw a tomato at it.

You can thank me by being the best you.

Keep up the greatness y'all,

Mark
