                <h1>Getting Started with ReactJS</h1>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>Getting started with React can be seriously daunting. One thing I have trouble with is the <em>WHY</em> must I do something.
                I've broken down some of the initial steps and concepts that I think you'll need to know to get yourself started with React.
                This won't be a tutorial as I think there are a bunch of resources out there. I want to give you enough to be dangerous and
                overcome the hump with getting up and running.</p>

                <h3>Knowing What You Need to Install</h3>
                <p>
                    The first thing you come across when looking at a React tutorial is the list of things you have to install. Looks something like:
                    <pre>npm install html-webpack-plugin webpack webpack-dev-server babel-{core,loader} babel-preset-react —save-dev</pre>
                    This list alone seems to be pretty intense if you are coming from a JQuery background or Angular background (which is where I'm from).
                    Immediately I freaked out because most tutorials just started by saying "Install these to get started." But again - <em>WHY?!</em>
                    <strong>Here's why</strong>
                    React has combination of language features and tools working in concert to deliver the promises made by framework. Broken down, each
                    of these tools makes sense if you know what you need them for.
                    <h4>First Up: Babel</h4>
                    What the heck is Babel you ask (I know I did)? It's a transpiler that will allows the brave among us to write code that is future
                    compliant (e.g., ES2015, ES2016 and BEYOND!). This is a great proposition since one of the hardest parts about being a Front End Developer
                    is knowing having to read about all the new features you can't use until all of your clients move from IE9. Babel makes that process less
                    painful. In React, Babel is used for ES2015+ features AND the JSX language used to define UI components.
                    <pre>npm install babel-{core,loader} --save-dev<br />npm install babel-preset-react --save-dev</pre>
                    <em>I don't always write React code, but when I do I use JSX</em>
                    <h4>Next: WebPack</h4>
                    If I were giving awards, I'd award the webpack team for having a great tool that noone knows exactly how it works and what it does! Webpack is
                    a multi-tool that will do things like run your babel transpilation, start up a web server for development (or you can use the python
                    SimpleHTTPServer like the rest of us!) and many more features. All of this is due to it's processing of loaders (modules that can extend
                    the functionality of the tool.) In React-land, it's used to run Babel, help create your dist HTML file and bundle your code. These are incredibly
                    helpful because they start to take the drama out of dependency management (though you still need to deal with npm for new packages). Now these
                    don't look so scary, right?
                    <pre>npm install html-webpack-plugin --save-dev<br />npm install webpack --save-dev<br />npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev<br /></pre>
                    If we put it together, we get our bootstrap command of:
                    <pre>npm install html-webpack-plugin webpack webpack-dev-server babel-{core,loader} babel-preset-react —save-dev</pre>
                    <h4>And Let's not forget why we came: React!</h4>
                    React is split into two primary modules (for the "Getting Started" crowd)
                    <pre>npm install react react-dom</pre>
                </p>
