Hey, folks - yes you read this title correctly: I wrote a book. While teaching my coding bootcamp, I found myself regularly sharing my life lessons and all the various things I'd learned from years in the development industry with my students. I shared my triumphs and failures with an open candid nature. Jokingly, I mentioned to my class that I was going to write a book filled with these anecdotes, stories, and bits of wisdom. That's when Rock Paper Coding was born.

At the suggestion of a colleague and good friend of mine (NR), I have decided to share the chapters here on my blog for anyone to read. Thank you for even taking the time to read these posts and for reading my thoughts. I look forward to the conversations they bring about. Tonight, I'm going to take that step forward and make this book even more real by posting chapter one.

Here we go.
