         Chapter five of my book - Rock Paper Coding. Let's talk about relationships with the business teams and more.
---
This chapter is a play on two ideas: the business as a group of non-technical users and the business as in the company you are working for at the time of reading. Chaing the way you deal with both has the potential to impact your career significantly.

I love the imaginary line drawn between the business team and the development team. I don't love that, or any line, needlessly separating working groups. From my experience, developers tend to crave to separate themselves from the non-technical team members to avoid dealing with their perceived lack of knowledge of technical topics. Listen, I'm like everyone else! I don't enjoy a person coming to my desk suggesting a solution to a challenging problem while implying its simplicity. I also don't fancy the scenario where they advocate on a customer's behalf and propose a new feature. It isn't the new feature that's troublesome; it's the fact that we know will require weeks worth of work and disrupt our workflow. I understand where you are coming from and your concerns. You aren't alone in your feelings about this. Now, with that out of the way, let us approach this conflict from a different point of view. As with everything else in this book the focus is squarely on a larger scale thought process. Business users are not the enemy. Those particular team members (emphasis on TEAM) possess skills that fill needs within the organization. They fill a need the same way you fill a need as a developer. As a company, we represent a body, and the departments/teams are the various body parts. This body cannot function at maximum efficacy unless all of its members are working in concert. The body must develop into a well-oiled machine (robot much?). Those business team members are a vital part of the body just as we are. It is foolish to adopt the conceit that we as developers are more important than anyone else. Yes, we build the product, but we do not sell the product. We don't conduct the market research necessary to guide the development and direction of the product. Even if that were the case, it would be an ineffective use of our time. Our core competency is problem-solving and creating things with code. It is challenging to be a full-time sales person and a full-time engineer. Baring experiences from building startups this is not the way we work best. Thus, it is mission-critical to get a grip on our disdain for those other teams and turn an eye toward collaboration.

Loving the business does not mean bending to their every whim and desire, rather it means that we start to look for opportunities to work in a collaborative state. A more comprehensive view of the goals of the business is more important than your ego. If you can learn to communicate and collaborate with the business team successfully, it opens doors that can personally elevate you to a new, higher level. It gives you an easy out against the "code monkey" moniker. Early on in my career (ahem, last week), a small fire would be set ablaze when someone outside of the development team would make a new request. The tiny rage was not born out of a desire to create a stressful working relationship. The reaction originated because the ask would feel invasive and disruptive. A little voice in my head would tell me that we developers knew what was best not anyone else! It was almost as if the person making the request didn't care what I thought about the direction of the software I spent so many hours crafting. Of course, this wasn't the case, but it is what my mind conjured. Whether or not this feeling resonates with you, it is still vital to understand the implications. My feelings, justified or not, obscured my ability to see and champion the goal of the company. The goal is always to achieve maximum success. The business team member is only offering their solution that will hopefully move the needle toward that calling. Here's a better way to handle that scenario collaborate with a critical eye. 

As developers, our first instinct is, of course, to code. We believe that the system that we are coding will bring money to the business. The ability to code and thus practically influence the platform can conflate our understanding of the actual value model. I've talked at some length (and will continue to) about the value we add being bigger than the code we write. The danger presented is in direct relation to our interaction with the business. Taking the hard stance that the business users are unable to contribute to the value model removes the opportunities to combine the subject matter expertise of both groups to create something groundbreaking. The intention is not to declare a winner in the business vs. development battle royale. Deciding a winner is counter productive.  A better way to navigate this relationship is to try to understand the motivations behind each party. What is the outstanding need that is behind the requests that are causing the tug-o-war? Choosing to position yourself in a way that is focused primarily on understanding can open communication pathways that can lead to healthy compromise. While idealistic, modeling this communicative state can inspire a reciprocal effect that can lead your teams into a new, more impactful, place.

After tackling the relationship with the business team we now have space to start working on the relationship with the business itself. Learning to love the business itself can be a gateway into valuable, career changing insight. Working someplace where you don't believe in the mission and goals of the company means that you are going to resent your employment eventually. Life is too short to waste your time - change your attitude or move on. If you find yourself unable to love the business because of unethical or immoral business practices, my advice is a bit more one sided - get out now. If you don't have any objections to your employer's practices, let us explore the meaning of "love the business." 

Love here is a metaphor for the type of dedication I'm suggesting you have towards the company's mission and the market the company operates. For example, if your employer works in medical device software one should start to understand the needs of that industry. Perform due diligence and try to gain insight regarding the motivations, needs, and direction of that space. Having more than a basic working knowledge of the needs of an industry allows you to develop intentional software. We often find ourselves having to make decisions about aspects of software features. At times it can be difficult to know what change to make when there isn't a subject matter expert on hand to help. Your knowledge of the industry gives you the ability to think critically and realistically about potential suggestions. Having insight into the direction of things is significantly more challenging and thus potentially that much more rewarding. That knowledge gives you the ability to predict where the software should be going and supplies you an influential position in discussions about the future of the product. There is no guarantee that you'll be privy to those conversations but when the opportunities present themselves, your knowledge will be useful. Consider the value you add in this scenario! Not only are you collaborating with business teams, but you are also adding meaningful input that can help the business succeed. This behavior is career rocket fuel.  You can thank me when you get to the top.

Both these areas require effort and intentionality. If these tasks were easy, it would be the default behavior across companies, and we'd only hear about mega rock star developers killing the game everywhere. Not quite the case, right? Cross team collaboration (and humility) will create new opportunities for personal growth and growth in the team dynamic. Having a "how can I help" attitude gives you a better working relationship. Understanding and even growing to champion your employer's place in the market does wonders for your value add to the company and for added value to your career.
