Preface
I don't care about the facts and the stats. Rock, Paper, Coding (RPC) is not a book with data from a company survey or some other source of employment statistics. If you are here, then that lets me know that you want to be an engineer. You may not refer to this occupation by that name (though you should), but this is what you want. RPC is a book about my life experience and many of the lessons learned from working and things that I have learned from just being myself in the workforce. This book is best described as my attempt to mentor you as you embark on a journey down the ever-evolving road of technology.

What qualifies me to mentor anyone in the first place? My willingness to teach others what I've learned through hard fought lessons and pleasant experiences alike. I have worked with a large variety of developers as well as have had the opportunity to be mentored by some brilliant people. I've been on teams with developers so smart that they don't understand why you can't understand a topic they've so diligently explained. I've also worked with the type of developers that were not technically strong but certainly desired to work hard and aspired to be the best that they could be. I've nearly seen it all. Because of this, I feel uniquely equipped to share what I've learned. As with development, in general, there is always more than one way to skin a cat. There is more than one way to be successful. This book documents a few of those ways.
